The port in your Geyser config is already in use, often by another Geyser instance, query port, or voice chat mod/plugin.
- If you’re self-hosting, close any applications using that port, or restart your computer if you’re unsure what’s running.
- If you’re using a hosting provider, use the specific port allocated to you.
