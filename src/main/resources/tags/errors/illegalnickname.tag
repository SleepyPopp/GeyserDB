This error occurs because login plugins such as AuthMe are not supported with Geyser and indicate that your server is running in offline mode. Since offline mode enables software piracy, which is illegal, we cannot provide support for any issues caused by it. For allowing Bedrock players without a Minecraft Java Edition account on your Geyser server, please use [Floodgate](https://wiki.geysermc.org/floodgate/setup/) with online mode.
