If you are getting a form with "You need a Java Edition account to play on this server", you will either need to link a Java Edition account or install [Floodgate](https://geysermc.org/wiki/floodgate/setup/) which allows Bedrock players without a Minecraft Java Edition account on your Geyser server.
