This happens when Geyser canâ€™t validate your login, often due to the client not sending the right data or not being logged in. You can use the following steps to debug this:
1. Double check you are actually logged in.
2. Restart your game and try again.
3. Try joining a featured server:
-- If you face the same issue, continue through the steps.
-- If you don't, send a dump link (Run `!!dump` in <#613194762249437245> for more information).
4. Log out of your account, then log back in.
5. Restart your device.
6. If the issue still persists, contact Minecraft support.
