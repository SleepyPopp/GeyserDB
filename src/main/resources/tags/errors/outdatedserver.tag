This error means that you need to update your server/proxy to the latest version or install the ViaVersion plugin. 
Run `!download viaversion` in <#613194762249437245>.
Please read [this](https://madelinemiller.dev/blog/which-minecraft-version/) when considering what Minecraft version to use for your server.
