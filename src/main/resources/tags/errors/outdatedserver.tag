This error means that you need to update your server/proxy to the latest version or install/update the [ViaVersion](https://ci.viaversion.com/job/ViaVersion/) plugin.
- If you're using Geyser-Fabric/NeoForge, then you'll need to use [ViaProxy](https://github.com/ViaVersion/ViaProxy) or any other proxy with [ViaVersion](https://ci.viaversion.com/job/ViaVersion/) plugin.
- Please read [this](https://madelinemiller.dev/blog/which-minecraft-version/) when considering what Minecraft version to use for your server.
