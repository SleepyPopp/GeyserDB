A full log file is essential for debugging any issues. Snippets rarely tell the whole story.
MCLogs censors IPs and improves readability, making it the best way to share logs.

Upload your log file to MCLogs (linked below) and share the link here.

Log file locations:
- NeoForge, Fabric, Spigot/Paper, Standalone, Velocity, ViaProxy: `logs/latest.log`
