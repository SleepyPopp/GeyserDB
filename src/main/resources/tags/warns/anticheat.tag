---

Geyser does not perfectly replicate a Java client. Anticheat on servers **especially Hypixel** can pick up irregular behavior from Geyser and ban you.
└> This only applies when you are trying to join another server (that isn't hosted by you) with a Geyser Proxy such as GeyserConnect.
└> **Please exercise caution when going on large servers!**
