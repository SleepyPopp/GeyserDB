Hydraulic is a server-side mod, which allows for Bedrock players to join modded Minecraft: Java Edition servers (with clientside mods). This project works alongside Geyser to make this possible.

**:warning:Caution: Hydraulic is still in very early development and should not be used on production setups!**
You'll need the latest minecraft version for hydraulic to work.
