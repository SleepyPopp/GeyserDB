When using Geyser as a plugin, the Bedrock server IP address is usually the same as your Java server's IP address. With that being said, there are a few other Geyser-related services that have their own IP address:
- If you're looking for a hosted version of the GeyserConnect software, run `!!geyserconnect` in <#613194762249437245> for more info.
- If you just want to try out Geyser, we have a test server at `test.geysermc.org` (run `/tag testserver` in <#613194762249437245> for more info).
